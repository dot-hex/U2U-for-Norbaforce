#USB to USB for Norbaforce

This U2U is based on Hasu USB to USB with the rearranged component layout to fit Norbaforce housing. It's only compatible with Realforce R1 keyboard. However, It's easy to adapt it for Realforce R2 with the KiCad project.

QMK firmware is recommended - Enter DFU mode without having access to the physical rest switch with command keycode enable. (Although, there is a known issue of this port regarding not registering the board after computer reboot.)

Hasu U2U TMK firmware is also compatible.
